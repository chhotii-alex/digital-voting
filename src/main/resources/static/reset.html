Dear  ##NAME##,
Your username for logging in is ##USERNAME##.
I can't recover your old password, but here is a new password that will work after you click on the link below:
##PASS##
<a href="##BASEURL##/reset?user=##QUERYUSER##&code=##RESET##">##BASEURL##/reset?user=##QUERYUSER##&code=##RESET##</a>
If you do not want to change your password, just delete this message. Your old password will still work if you don't
click the link above.

Sincerely,
the Digital On-line Voting Platform
