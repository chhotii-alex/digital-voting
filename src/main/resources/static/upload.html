    Click on the button to upload a spreadsheet listing the people who should be allowed to vote.
    The spreadsheet should be text-only, tab-delimited; i.e. don't try to upload an Excel document
    as-is, export to tab-delimited and upload that.<br/>
    There should be exactly two columns: email address, and name (real-person name not login name).<br/>
    Accounts will be created for people who don't have accounts.<br/>

    <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/voters/upload">
    <table>
        <tr><td>File to upload:</td><td><input type="file" name="file" /></td></tr>
        <tr><td></td><td><input type="submit" value="Upload" /></td></tr>
    </table>
    </form>
